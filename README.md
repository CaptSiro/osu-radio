Main Figma Design: [https://www.figma.com/design/tNBJr7TlEsoWsWdAewqoUg](https://www.figma.com/design/tNBJr7TlEsoWsWdAewqoUg/osu!-radio?node-id=0-1&t=aIuThZAj00HcSjM5-1)

[//]: # (You can remove the ${\textsf{\color{#f462a3}osu!}}$ if you just want it be osu!radio instead. That color can only work if there's spaces on both side)

# What is ${\textsf{\color{#f462a3}osu!}}$ radio
It's an application that play your ${\textsf{\color{#f462a3}osu!}}$ songs!

![Song Tab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da67b906-1429-4cc1-9087-76026e94b98a "The screen show a UI with all the buttons (Play, Pause, Forward and Rewind, as well as a Seek bar, with 4 songs on the left")

### Download Guide

> To use `git` and `npm`, you need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) & [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed

`1` | Open the terminal in the directory you want to download osu!radio in. Then do the following command,
```
git clone https://github.com/Team-BTMC/osu-radio.git
```

`2` | Next, install the necessary files to run osu!radio,
```
npm install
```

`3` | To start it up, run this command,
```
npm run start
```

# The Vision

Technologies:
- ${\textsf{\color{#9feaf9}Electron}}$
- ${\textsf{\color{#4c84c5}Solid JS}}$
- ${\textsf{\color{#3178c6}Typescript}}$

Main dicussion is in the [BTMC TALENT SERVER](https://discord.gg/mefjfMjV), #prj-osu-radio
<br>
We'll be staying on Electron for the time being. As for UI, it will stay web-based for ease of use & cost of being web-based :)
