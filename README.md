This is primarily personal projects so there could be "idk, works for me" and if it is not trivial fix I might not ever fix it. Also, if it breaks then... RIPBOZO

### Contribution

I only know how to push code from my local machine to this repository, so, you can forget about pull requests LOL. Definitely a skill issue.

### Download

LOL, it can barely play songs. You better wait a few months. But if you still want to give it a try, then git clone this repository and run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```
